## Overview

Project Spectral is an AI-driven hacking assistant designed to revolutionize offensive security tasks. Inspired by Morpheus V2, this project builds on the concept of leveraging AI for malware analysis and extends it into an all-encompassing hacking assistant. Project Spectral aims to streamline workflows for ethical hackers, making tasks like reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation more intuitive, efficient, and collaborative.

This project will make hacking less isolating by offering an AI companion to support users through various stages of their journey—from recon to privilege escalation and beyond.
