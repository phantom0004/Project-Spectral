## Overview üìù

Project Spectral is an AI-driven hacking assistant designed to automate offensive security tasks. Project Spectral aims to streamline workflows for ethical hackers, making tasks like reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation more intuitive, efficient, and collaborative. This project will make hacking less isolating by offering an AI companion to support users through various stages of their journey‚Äîfrom recon to privilege escalation and beyond.

## Current Status üìä

Project Spectral has moved beyond the ideation phase and entered early development. A significant focus of the current phase is the implementation and testing of the base model for Spectral AI, ensuring it is adequate for simple Q&A tasks while balancing performance and storage efficiency. This involves rigorously evaluating the base model to ensure it meets these criteria as the foundation for more advanced capabilities.

Once the initial model has been finalized and deemed suitable, the next phase will involve exploring and curating datasets to fine-tune the AI for cybersecurity-specific tasks. This progression ensures that the foundational architecture is solid before expanding into more complex functionalities. Updates on the chosen model and progress in dataset integration will follow as the development evolves. Stay tuned for more insights as Spectral AI takes shape.

## Inspiration üí°

Project Spectral takes inspiration from Morpheus V2 (click [here](https://github.com/phantom0004/morpheus_IOC_scanner) to view the project), a tool that utilized AI for malware analysis by generating verdicts based on matched signatures. Building on this foundation, Project Spectral will push the boundaries by introducing offensive security capabilities tailored for ethical hackers, creating an intelligent AI chat assistant that operates at the forefront of cybersecurity innovation.
