## Overview 📝

**Project Spectral** is an **AI-driven hacking assistant** designed to **automate offensive security tasks**. Leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence, Project Spectral streamlines workflows for ethical hackers, making complex tasks like *reconnaissance*, *exploitation*, and *post-exploitation* more **intuitive**, **efficient**, and **collaborative**.

### 🔍 Key Objectives

- **Automation of Offensive Tasks:** Reduce manual effort by automating repetitive and time-consuming security tasks.
- **Enhanced Workflow Efficiency:** Optimize the hacking process to allow ethical hackers to focus on strategic decision-making.
- **Collaborative Environment:** Foster a more connected and supportive hacking community through AI-driven assistance.
- **Comprehensive Support:** Provide guidance and support throughout various stages of ethical hacking, from initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation and beyond.

### 🤖 AI Companion

This project aims to make hacking **less isolating** by offering an **AI companion** that supports users through their hacking journey. Whether you're conducting a penetration test, participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, or engaging in offensive security operations, Project Spectral is here to assist you every step of the way.

## What Project Spectral Includes 🧰

**Project Spectral** utilizes a **keyless API** to deliver a **Large Language Model (LLM)** on any system efficiently, without constraints or slowdowns. This capability allows Project Spectral to **utilize Mistral**, enabling it to process and analyze large datasets, extract valuable insights, and comprehend complex relationships and questions.

**Project Spectral** builds upon **Mistral AI** by adding several enhancements, including:

- 🖥️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides a clean and intuitive view of the application.
- 🌐 **Web Crawling:** Enables the AI to search and navigate through web links.
- 🧠 **Persistent Memory:** Stores all previous messages, allowing for context retention.
- 💻 **Terminal Integration:** Understands the user's machine and the outputs of commands.
- 📄 **Code Extraction:** Extracts important elements like commands from outputs for later use.
- 🤖 **Advanced Prompting:** Utilizes Mistral AI with various prompts, such as leveraging DAN (updated for Spectral) for payload generation or utilizing its knowledge base for text summaries.
- 🚀 **And Much More!**

These enhancements seamlessly integrate with **Spectral AI**, allowing it to leverage a comprehensive large language model without limitations, further customized for hacking tasks.
